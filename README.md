This repository provides a lightweight utility to convert **Cantera YAML chemical mechanisms** into **OpenFOAM** compatible files. It supports pressure-dependent reactions and offers options to either embed PLOG data or evaluate the mechanism at a specific reference pressure.

---

## üõ† Requirements

* **OpenFOAM-7-13**
  Most popular OpenFOAM foundation versions are all supported.
  
  For ESI versions of OpenFOAM, results converted from OpenFOAM-7 can generally be used with only minor adjustments.
* **Python 3** with the `Cantera` package installed

---

## üöÄ Basic Usage

Run the converter by specifying:

* A directory containing `chem.yaml` and `transportProperties` (in OpenFOAM format using Sutherland coefficients)
* An output directory

```bash
python convert.py <cantera_mech_dir> <output_dir>
```

To evaluate pressure-dependent reactions at a specific pressure (in **bar**), use:

```bash
python convert.py <cantera_mech_dir> <output_dir> --pressure 60 --version <target_openfoam_version_from_7_to_13>
```

If no pressure is specified, pressure-dependent reactions are written using OpenFOAM‚Äôs `ArrheniusPLOG` format.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** OpenFOAM does not natively evaluate PLOG expressions. External libraries must be required, see:
>
> * [OpenFOAM-7-OpenFOAM-13 PLOG support](https://github.com/Fluid-Mechanics-Lund-University/plogs)

---
## üß™ Testing

Two helper scripts are included:

* `./Allconvert` ‚Äì batch converts example mechanisms in `./mechs`
* `./Alltest` ‚Äì runs conversion and executes `chemFoam` test cases

Results are saved in the `results/` directory with CSV files and plots.

## üìä Results

### 1. GRI Mechanism (No PLOG)

Comparison between `chemkinToFoam` and this converter. Ignition delay times show good agreement.

### 2. Xu Mechanism with PLOG

Source:
[Xu et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236122026564)

Demonstrates how different reference pressures lead to varying behaviors in ignition delay.
